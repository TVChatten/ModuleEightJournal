    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

    I can ensure tht my software is functional and secure by incorporating unit testing - to test individual aspects of my code. I would also incorporate integration testing to see how different portinos of the code interact with one another. Then there's         also security testing in being able to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.
    
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

    I can interpret user needs by gathering and analyzing user feedback, so that I can understand their needs and then identify common patterns among those needs.
    
    How do I approach designing software?
    I can approach designing software by meeting with the client to understand what the software is for and to gather their needs on the particular software. Then I can incorporate planning within their needs by drawing out tests (unit, integrational,             security) to make sure that things are aligning how they're suppose to.
